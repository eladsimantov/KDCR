# Kinematics Dynamics and Control of Robots (KDBR)
This repository includes the code used for the problem sets presented in the course "KDCR" at the Technion.

## HW1 - Serial Robotics
Main filename:  *HW1.m*     
Report:         *HW1 KDCR.pdf*   
In this project we found the Forward and Inverse kinematics of a serial robot and conducted a Singularity analysis. 

## HW2 - Parallel Robotics
Main filename:  *HW2.m*  
Report:         *HW2 KDCR.pdf*   
In this project we found the Forward and Inverse kinematics of a parallel robot and conducted a Singularity analysis.

## HW3 - Dynamics
Main filename:  *HW3.m*     
Report:         confidential   
In this project we took the serial robot from HW1 and found its dynamics model.     
We then ran a numerical simulation (ode45) of the robot dynamics subject to uncertainty and a planned control law.

## HW4 - Control
Main filename:  *HW4.m*     
Report:         *HW4 KDCR.pdf*   
In this project we took the serial robot from HW1, and then designed and compared different control schemes.
We ran a numerical simulation of the robot dynamics for each control law, and considered their performance using various design metrics.    
(1) Inverse Dynamics + PD Control Law   
(2) Gravity + PD  Control Law   
(3) PID Control Law    
(4) MIN-MAX Control Law
