# Kinematics Dynamics and Control of Robots (KDBR)
This repository includes the code used for the problem sets presented in the course "KDCR" at the Technion.

## HW1 - Serial Robotics
Main filename:  *HW1.m*     
Report:         *HW1 KDCR.pdf*   
In this project we found the Forward and Inverse kinematics of a serial robot and conducted a Singularity analysis.     
In addition, we planned its motion using three different velocity profiles (Constant, Trapezoidal, Polynomial).     
We also computed its torques and moments and compared the kinematics of the different profiles. 

## HW2 - Parallel Robotics
Main filename:  *HW2.m*  
Report:         *HW2 KDCR.pdf*   
In this project we found the Forward and Inverse kinematics of a parallel robot and conducted a Singularity analysis.

## HW3 - Dynamics
Main filename:  *HW3.m*     
Report:         confidential   
In this project we took the serial robot from HW1 and found its dynamics model.     
We then ran a numerical simulation (ode45) of the robot dynamics subject to uncertainty and a planned control law.

## HW4 - Control
Main filename:  *HW4.m*     
Report:         *HW4 KDCR.pdf*   
In this project we took the serial robot from HW1, and then designed and compared different control schemes.
We ran a numerical simulation of the robot dynamics for each control law, and considered their performance using various design metrics.    
(1) Inverse Dynamics + PD Control Law   
(2) Gravity + PD  Control Law   
(3) PID Control Law    
(4) MIN-MAX Control Law
